This web game is a classic space shooter where you control a spaceship, dodging rocks and shooting down enemies. As you navigate through space, the enemies gradually increase in speed, making the game more challenging. Use the left and right arrow keys to move your spaceship, and the spacebar to fire bullets. Your goal is to destroy as many enemies as possible while avoiding collisions with enemies and rocks. The game keeps track of your score, and ends when an enemy collides with your spaceship. Try to achieve the highest score!
